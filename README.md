# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition
Communication with an individual who is unable to speak and/or hear can be challenging. The only mode of communi- cation is through sign languages. Since sign languages have a learning curve and not everyone can use sign languages to communicate, an application that can automatically translate the sign language to text/speech will be useful to both cate- gories of individuals to communicate. We introduce a solution to this problem by applying computer vision and machine learning concepts. While this application detects letters and numbers in real-time, it forms a solid foundation for the application to translate complex gestures into words, sentences and phrases in real time.
